# Tetris-Balance-Game

This is a small game made using python and was inspired by a creation on Thingiverse linked here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5411076/files

To play the game you will need to 3D-print the parts from this Thingiverse thing.

This program is essentially a randomizer that tells you which tetris piece to put on the base next. The objective? Place all the pieces on the base without having
fall off. You select how many of each piece you are playing with(1-4), for totals of 7,14,21,and 28. Quite a simple game right?

Note:  It is impossible for the game to generate a light blue 1x4 piece as the first piece since it would be simply unfair ;)

Note: Keep the dependencies (the images and the audios) in the same folder as the progam for it to work

Note: I also don't own Tetris or the cute little difficulty faces that came from Geometry Dash. This is a personal creation for non-commercial use, but feel free to play!
